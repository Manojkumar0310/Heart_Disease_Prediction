# Heart_Disease_Prediction

This project aims to develop a heart disease prediction system using machine learning algorithms.
The goal is to identify individuals who are at risk of cardiovascular issues, enabling early diagnosis and targeted preventive interventions

# Dataset:
The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing patient information, medical history, lifestyle habits, and diagnostic test results. 
The dataset has been preprocessed to handle missing values, standardize features, and remove noise.

# Feature Engineering:
Relevant features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking habits, and exercise patterns have been extracted from the dataset. 
Additionally, derived features have been created to capture important interactions and relationships.

# Model Development:
Several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, have been implemented and evaluated for their predictive performance.
Cross-validation techniques have been employed to ensure robustness and optimize model hyperparameters.

# Evaluation Metrics:
The models have been evaluated using appropriate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. 
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Area Under the Curve (AUC) values have also been utilized to assess model performance.
